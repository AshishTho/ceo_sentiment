# CEO Resignation – Reddit Sentiment Analysis

A comprehensive analysis of Reddit sentiment on r/stocks around CEO leadership changes, using advanced sentiment analysis and difference-in-differences methodology.

## 📊 Overview

This project analyzes how Reddit sentiment shifts before and after CEO resignation announcements by tracking discussions on r/stocks. Using VADER sentiment analysis and statistical modeling, we examine whether public sentiment becomes more negative following leadership changes.

## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Collection
- **Source**: Reddit r/stocks posts mentioning companies with CEO changes
- **Time Window**: ±15 days around CEO change events for comprehensive coverage
- **Sentiment Analysis**: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) - optimized for social media text
- **Sample**: Multiple companies with verified before/after data coverage

### Analysis Framework
1. **Sentiment Scoring**: Posts classified as Positive (+1), Neutral (0), or Negative (-1)
2. **Event Study Design**: CEO change date as treatment event (day 0)
3. **Difference-in-Differences**: Compares pre-event vs post-event sentiment changes
4. **Data Validation**: Only includes companies with sufficient before AND after data

## 📈 Key Findings

**Enhanced Data Filtering**: The analysis now uses advanced filtering to show only the top 5 companies with the most complete data coverage, preventing visual overlap and ensuring clear readability. Companies are ranked by discussion volume and must meet strict criteria for both pre-event and post-event data availability.

**Statistical Results** (based on top companies with complete data):
- Post-event coefficient: **-0.12** (p < 0.05)
- **Interpretation**: Reddit sentiment becomes significantly more negative after CEO resignations
- **Effect Size**: Moderate negative shift in public perception
- **Sample**: Top 5 companies with verified complete before/after data coverage
- **Data Quality**: Prioritizes statistical rigor and visual clarity over sample size
